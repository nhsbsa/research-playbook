## UX research
User Researchers and designers use a variety of key tools of user-centred design to help aid the design of our services. 
This includes:
* user interviews
* personas
* user journey mapping
* storyboarding
* prototyping
* usability testing

But more frequently, using 'Design Thinking' methods to aid team dynamics, business development, innovation and stakeholder relationships, as well as creative ways to embed design research into the teams way of working.
