## Overview

The NHSBSA’s Research Ethics Policy is intended to support research activities undertaken by NHSBSA staff and those carrying out research on behalf of the NHSBSA (e.g. delivery partners).  It aims to enhance your research, and not to constrain it, by encouraging careful consideration of and creative solutions to any ethical questions or challenges that arise.

> **‘Research ethics’ refers to  the moral principles guiding research from its inception through to completion and publication of results.** *- BPS Code of Human Research Ethics*

## Considerations
We encourage all staff members or contractor that is undertaking research activities, not just those with ‘Researcher’ in their job title, to:
* think carefully about your research and its implications for others, including [unintended consequences](https://doteveryone.org.uk/project/consequence-scanning/)
* consider whether there are ethical issues you need to consider and address
* ensure your research is robust and has measure of success imbedded
* ensure you as a researcher, and any participants in your project, are protected from unforeseen challenges and harm

## Existing Policies and codes of practice
As a User Researcher in number of local policies and codes of practice to work within (including the NHS Constitution)
When doing some types of research, we  might need to satisfy external ethical requirements (e.g. NHS Ethics in clinical settings or National Research Committee in Prisons)

1) Validity: Researchers produce findings that accurately represent users and the phenomena of interest
2) Wellbeing: Researchers minimize the risks and maximize the benefits research participants experience
3) Autonomy: Researchers disclose enough information to research participants so they can make an informed decision to take part in the study. Researchers also avoid manipulating or coercing participants to remain in a study
4) Privacy and Security: Researchers keep research participants’ personal data private and safe
5) Honesty: Researchers report findings to stakeholders accurately
6) Value: Researchers conduct research that tests important organizational assumptions and influences strategy

## Principles we follow
The [10 principles of design ethics](https://designjustice.org/read-the-principles) by the Design Justice Network are very good principles to follow and we try to be mindful when we evaluate our work.

We believe that every designer and a researcher at the NHSBSA has the power to make a difference. A huge amount of that comes from challenging privilege from the perspective of our users. The BMJ did a very good [blog](https://blogs.bmj.com/bmj/2020/04/16/confronting-power-and-privilege-for-inclusive-equitable-and-healthy-communities/) to frame these discussions.
